    "# Scaling your Deep Learning Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third lab of the course. So far, you've learned about stochastic gradient descent and the effects of batch size on training. You've also learned how to scale training from a single GPU to multiple GPUs. You should have seen a considerable speedup that we'll be measuring in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen that as we scale to multiple GPUs, we effectively increase the batch size. From our testing in lab one, we know that increasing the batch size can increase throughput, but it can also affect a network's ability to train effectively. In this lab, you'll be exploring how training is affected when scaling to multiple GPUs. We will start with measuring the effect of multiple GPUs on throughput, in our case images per second. You'll then go on to learn tools and techniques that can help to maintain high accuracy as you scale."

    "## Scaling of Performance: Images/Second \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lab, you evaluated images/second as a measurement of performance of the training. We saw that throughput increased with batch size, but only to a certain point. As the batch size increased to saturate the GPU memory, we saw diminishing returns. Now that we are scaling to multiple GPUs, it would make sense that our throughput would increase once again. How do you think throughput will scale with respect the the number of GPUs used in the training?\n",
    "\n",
    "As in Lab 1, we have a callback that measures throughput in images/second after each epoch. Run the cell below __on one GPU__ and record the throughput in the code cell down below. As you might recall from Lab 1, throughput in the first epoch should be ignored because we are paying one-time costs, so choose a throughput from the second or third epoch."

Horovod, and the NCCL library, do a good job of maintaining high throughput, but performance is intricately tied to the hardware in use. The requirement to have high bandwidth and low latency between GPUs on the same node is what led to the development of the NVLink interconnect, which is what the server used for this course deploys for linking up the GPUs on the node.

    "## Adjusting the Optimizer: Adding Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've modified our training by altering batch size, as well as distributing across multiple GPUs. We'll explore other hyperparameters, such as learning rate later in the lab. In this section, we'll explore another key tool in improving our training process: selecting and tuning the optimizer that we use. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall in Lab 1, the optimizer updates the weights of the network in order to minimize the loss function. In the stochastic gradient descent optimizer that we've used so far, weights are updated based on their gradient with respect to the loss function of a mini-batch. In other words, we determine how altering a weight will affect the loss, and move a small step in the direction that minimizes that loss for the mini-batch. By taking those steps with each back-propagation, we slowly make our way toward a global minima, decreasing our loss, and increasing our accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this process works well, it can be improved upon. One downside is that if the network gets near a local minimum or saddle point, the gradient can be quite small, and the training will slow down in that area. The noise introduced by using minibatches might help the model find its way out, but it might take some time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there may be areas where the algorithm keeps taking steps in the roughly the same direction. It would be advantageous in those areas if the optimizer helped us take larger steps to move toward the global minimum faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good solution to these issues is to use momentum. Instead of the algorithm taking a small independent step each time, adding momentum to our optimizer allows the process to retain a memory of the last several steps. If the weights have been moving in a certain direction on average, momentum will help continue to propel the updates in the same direction. If the training is also fluctuating back and forth, it can smooth out this movement. A decent analogy is a ball rolling down a hill, which will pick up and retain momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case implementing momentum is quite simple, as we do not have to alter the code of the optimizer. SGD algorithms will often accept a momentum parameter, as is the case in the Keras implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Alter the argument parser to accept a momentum argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "parser.add_argument('--momentum', type=float, default=0.9,\n",
    "                    help='SGD momentum')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Pass the momentum into the optimizer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "opt = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=args.base_lr, momentum=args.momentum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Update the CSV filename to include the momentum hyperparameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "data_filepath = \"training_data/{}ranks-{}bs-{}lr-{}m.csv\".format(hvd.size(), args.batch_size, args.base_lr, args.momentum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need any help, you can find the solution at `solutions/add_momentum.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training with Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the training again either for the same amount of time as before, or stopping at a certain accuracy using `--target-accuracy`. After the training completes, execute the plotting script to see the difference between training with and without momentum. "
