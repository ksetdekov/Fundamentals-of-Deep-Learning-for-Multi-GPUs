    "## Scaling Learning Rate with Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to recognize that when we scale our training to multiple GPUs, the batch size that we give each GPU is not the overall effective batch size. After each mini-batch is processed and a single GPU performs backpropagation, those weights are averaged among all the ranks. As a result, one update to the model takes into account every mini-batch, accross all the GPUs. The effective batch size is therefore the size of the mini-batch multiplied by the number of GPUs. As a result, when more and more GPUs are used, the effective batch size can get very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw in Lab 1, larger batch sizes can lead to drops in accuracy, especially in a network's ability to generalize. The effect of a larger batch size also brings us closer to full batch gradient descent, and takes some of the variance or noise out of the process. Additionally, with a larger batch size fewer update steps are taken per epoch, which can slow down the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common approach to adding variance back into the process, as well as accounting for fewer steps per epoch, is to increase the learning rate as you increase batch size. As the algorithm takes fewer steps per epoch, adjusting the learning rate compensates for this with a larger step each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theory suggests that if we scale batch size by K, we should scale learning rate by the square root of K to maintain the variance. It's also common in large scale training to adjust the learning rate linearly, by a factor of K. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, take about 15-20 minutes experimenting with different learning rates and batch sizes. Try holding the batch size steady while increasing the learning rate, and then try increasing the batch size while holding the learning rate steady. Finally, as you continue to increase the batch size, increase the learning rate as well. Try batch sizes up to 128 or even 256, and a learning rate up to .08 or higher. We recommend that you pick a certain validation accuracy for the training to reach using `--target-accuracy`, or to simply run the training for 2-3 minutes each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the chart regularly to see how training runs compare. Again, feel free to remove datasets from the `training_data` folder if the chart gets too crowded. \n",
    "\n",
    "The object of the exercise is not necessarily to find the \"optimal\" combination, but more to get a feel for the trends as you adjust the parameters. Note that because of the randomness in the process, both in terms of the starting weights, as well as the shuffling of the data, you are not guaranteed to get the same results when you run the same training twice.   \n",
    "\n",
    "When you feel you have a good understanding of how the training is affected, move on to the next section."

    "#### Layer-wise learning rate control\n",
    "\n",
    "NovoGrad combines several insights about SGD. First, it recognizes that gradient updates should be decoupled from the absolute magnitude of the gradient -- the direction is more important than the size. The magnitude of an update should be of order the magnitude of the weight multiplied by the learning rate, and since the learning rate is sufficiently small, this means that we make relatively small updates as we search for the optimum. Unfortunately, traditional SGD does not enforce this; the update to the weights $\\mathbf{w}$ is in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  \\large\n",
    "  \\Delta \\mathbf{w} = -\\lambda\\, \\mathbf{g}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the learning rate and $\\mathbf{g}$ is the gradient of the loss function. The size of the gradient is determined by the loss function, which is not required to be commensurate with the scale of the weight. Furthermore, backpropagation tends to exacerbate this issue (i.e. the [vanishing gradient (or exploding gradient) problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem) that plagued deep CNNs until algorithmic improvements like [residual connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) were developed). Most SGD algorithms developed over the past few years attempt to solve this problem in one way or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "An intuitive way to deal with this is simply to divide the gradients on each layer by the norm of the gradients of that layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  \\large\n",
    "  \\Delta \\mathbf{w} = -\\lambda\\, \\frac{\\mathbf{g}}{|\\mathbf{g}|}\n",

    "where the norm $|\\mathbf{g}|$ is typically the root-mean-square operation. This can generally be described as [stochastic normalized gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02030).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about this is that, in a sense, the update has the wrong units (see Section 3.2 in the [ADADELTA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5701) for a more rigorous discussion than this one). That is, if we imagine that the weights have a dimension (say, meters) and we take the partial derivative with respect to time, then the gradient has units of meters per second (that is, a speed or velocity), and applying an update to a position by adding a velocity does not make sense. We need to update the distance by an amount in meters. Dividing by the gradient by a norm makes the update dimensionless, and we can recover the correct scale by scaling the update by the norm of the weights. That is, we could have an update of the form\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "which has the desired scale and units, but still points in the direction of the gradient of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these approaches largely prevent vanishing/exploding gradients from causing the optimization process to diverge, because the magnitude of the update is now uncoupled from the absolute scale of the gradient, which could be much larger or much smaller than the weights on that layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach was taken with the [LARS optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03888), which defines the update on a given layer as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  \\large\n",
    "  \\Delta \\mathbf{w} = -\\lambda^{\\mathrm{global}}\\, \\lambda^{\\mathrm{local}}\\, \\mathbf{g}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the \"global\" learning rate is the normal learning rate policy you're familiar with (some small number like 0.01 that may decay over time), and the \"local\" per-layer learning rate is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "  \\lambda^{\\mathrm{local}} = \\eta\\, \\frac{|\\mathbf{w}|}{|\\mathbf{g}|}\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that LARS is very closedly related to [LARC (Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Control)](https://nvidia.github.io/OpenSeq2Seq/html/optimizers.html) and the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

    "\n",
    "#### Gradient averaging and momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "A separate set of efforts uses the concept of gradient averaging: the gradient we apply should be an average of the gradient in this step and the gradient in the previous step. As an illustration, we have already discussed how momentum can be used to avoid being trapped in local minima and to more efficiently escape saddle points. SGD with momentum can in fact be seen as a form of gradient averaging -- the effective gradient is a linear combination of the gradient in this step and the gradient from the last step. Optimizers such as [RMSprop](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf) implement this idea; the update looks a lot like the LARS update, except that the norm of the gradient used in the denominator is a linear combination of the gradient from this step and the gradient from the last step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular implementation of this concept is the [Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) optimizer, which works as follows. Suppose we have an update in this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  \\large\n",
    "  \\Delta \\mathbf{w} = -\\lambda\\, \\frac{\\mathbf{m}}{\\sqrt{v}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{m}$ is a gradient-like term and $v$ is a term that is like the norm of the square of the gradient (so that we recover the earlier form if $\\mathbf{m} = \\mathbf{g}$ and $v = |\\mathbf{g}^2|$). We can implement gradient averaging in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  \\large\n",
    "  \\mathbf{m} = \\beta_{1}\\, \\mathbf{m}_{\\mathrm{prev}} + (1 - \\beta_{1})\\, \\mathbf{g}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{m}_{\\mathrm{prev}}$ was the \"gradient\" term on the previous step, and\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "  \\large\n",
    "  v = \\beta_{2}\\, v_{\\mathrm{prev}} + (1 - \\beta_{2})\\, |\\mathbf{g}^2|\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_{\\mathrm{prev}}$ was the \"gradient-squared\" term on the previous step. This means that we are keeping a running average of the gradient, rather than simply applying the gradient from this step. Adam is thus quite robust as a training optimizer compared to simpler optimizers like traditional SGD; however, it also tends to [generalize worse](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07628) than SGD with momentum.\n",

    "Hopefully the training converged for you more successfully than with standard stochastic gradient descent on the training dataset. Validation accuracy is probably poor in the early epochs, but after waiting for at least 10-20 epochs, you will likely see validation accuracy start to steadily improve and eventually converge to a desirable result. NovoGrad, as well as the other optimizers that are available are important tools to consider when you build your training pipeline. "

    "\n",
    "Multiple GPU training is quickly becoming a critical tool for engineers and data scientists. Accelerated training has made previously impossible AI challenges, such as complex image classification, solveable. Similarly, we have made amazing strides in natural language processing with the [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) model, which is often trained on dozens to hundreds of GPUs. But multi GPU training has the power to transform deep learning work at all levels, not just for high-end production implementations. If your training takes hours or even days, experimentation can become tedious and even impractical. Using multiple GPUs to speed up training allows for more time to be spent on refining and improving your model. It enables you to be more flexible and responsive, both in the initial phases of development and as you update and improve your model over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, you may have access to a multi GPU system such as an appliance based on the [HGX architecture](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/hgx/), or plan to use a cloud server, such as the one provided for this course. In either case, the [NGC Catalog](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/#ngc-platforms) gives you free access to performance-optimized AI software that provide DL frameworks, pre-trained models, and industry-focused end-to-end AI workflows. We use NGC containers in this course. In addition to removing the challenge associated with installing these frameworks, NGC containers are highly optimized for both training and inference on NVIDIA GPUs. Here’s the guide to [getting started with NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/collections/nvidia:gettingstarted); you can find the most up-to-date documentation in the [NVIDIA docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/index.html), along with specific setup steps for [Azure](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-azure-setup-guide/index.html), [AWS](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-aws-setup-guide/index.html), and [GCP](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/index.html#ngc-with-google-cloud-platform-(gcp). NGC containers are also set up to work right out of the box on dense GPU platforms for AI and computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for joining us in the course today. We hope you feel prepared and excited to apply multi GPU training to your next AI challenge. "
